--- UNIVERSAL RULES ---

**RULE 1: SKIN TEXTURE (CRITICAL)**
High-fidelity photorealistic skin rendering.
Visible pores, natural skin texture, realistic grain.
NO airbrushing. NO plastic-looking skin. NO blur. NO smoothing filters.

**RULE 2: THE BARRIER LAW (STATE)**
If action is "Interaction" (Angle 1, 2) and product is a container:
- The cap/lid/top MUST be removed and placed out of frame or held.
- The nozzle/opening MUST be exposed.
- Never show liquid or cream passing through a closed solid lid.

**RULE 3: BRAND SAFETY & HANDS**
- LABEL PROTECTION: Fingers must ONLY touch the sides or base of "${product.title}".
- LOGOTYPE CLEARANCE: The main logo/text MUST be 100% visible and facing the camera.
- ANATOMY: Exactly 2 hands. Realistic grip tension.

**RULE 4: ADAPTIVE FRAMING**
${distanceMandate}
COMPOSITION: Vertical alignment. If the product is large, it must fit its entire height into the frame.

[STEP 1: OUTFIT & BODY]
- DISCARD Image 1 body. Generate NEW contextual outfit.
- Examples: Wine -> Evening Wear. Shaker -> Fitness Wear. Watch -> Business Casual / Modern Lifestyle Wear.

[STEP 2: CAMERA LOGIC]
${angleVariation.replace('{{PRODUCT_TITLE}}', product?.title || 'item')}

[STEP 3: PHOTOGRAPHIC RENDER]
${lightingPrompt}
**RULE 5: PHOTOGRAPHIC INTEGRITY (CRITICAL)**
- MANDATE: The entire scene (model, product, background) MUST be rendered as a single raw photographic shot.
- REQUIRED: Natural photographic grain (ISO noise), subtle lens imperfections, and authentic color depth.
- PROHIBIT: Digital illustrations, 3D renders, vector lines, and airbrushed "perfect" cleanliness. 
- DETAIL: Render micro-pores on skin, dust particles on product glass, and brushed metal textures.
